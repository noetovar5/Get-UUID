UUID" stands for "Universally Unique Identifier." It is a 128-bit identifier that is used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. UUIDs are standardized and are intended to be unique across both space and time, meaning the probability of two UUIDs being the same is extremely low, even when generated on different devices at different times.

UUIDs are commonly represented as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits grouped into five sections, separated by hyphens, such as: 8-4-4-4-12 characters. They are frequently used in various information systems, databases, software development, and distributed systems to uniquely identify entities like documents, users, hardware components, or any other object requiring a unique identifier.

The generation of UUIDs follows various algorithms defined by different versions. Some commonly used versions include UUID1 (based on timestamp and MAC address), UUID3 and UUID5 (generated from a namespace and a name, using MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms, respectively), and UUID4 (randomly generated).

Overall, the purpose of a UUID is to provide a unique identifier that can be relied upon across different systems and applications without the need for a centralized authority to manage the identifier assignments.
